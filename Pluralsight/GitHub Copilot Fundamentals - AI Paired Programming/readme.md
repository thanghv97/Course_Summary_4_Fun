# GitHub Copilot Fundamentals - AI Paired Programming
## Course Overview
## Getting Started with GitHub Copilot
### The Age of AI 
  The pervasive influence of AI across various industries
  + `Music and Podcast industry`: **Spotify**'s use of AI for podcast translation and personalized music curation (New AI DJ)
  + `Photo industry`: 
    + **Adobe Photoshop**'s AI-driven photo editing tool
    + **Midjourney** and **DALL-E** specializing in image generation.
  + **ElevenLabs** and **Speechify** use AI for narration across different media formats and platforms
  + AI tools like **Gamma** and **Beautiful** are mentioned for their ability to generate documents, presentations, and web pages quickly
  + ChatGPT, the LLM-based chatbot by **OpenAI**
  + **GitHub Copilot**'s role in revolutionizing software development with AI assistance marked a significant shift in how developers code

### GitHub Copilot, Your AI Paired Programmer  
  + developed collaboratively by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft

### Features of GitHub Copilot
  + AI pair programmer that offers autocomplete style suggestions as you code
    + Similar to prompt-based AI tools like ChatGPT, the quality of suggestions in GitHub Copilot is influenced by the prompt provided by the developer
    + Supports all coding languages found in public repositories, with varying levels of suggestion quality depending on the language's representation in the repositories
    + Users must ensure the security and quality of their code, as suggestions may contain insecure patterns or outdated information
  + Code scanning, Dependabot, and GitHub Action to assist in code monitoring and improvement
  + GitHub Copilot X enhances the core features of Copilot with advanced capabilities using the latest GPT models, such as Copilot Chat, Copilot for PR, automatic test generation

  Pricing Options:
  + Copilot Individual - $10/month
  + Copilot Business - $19 per user/month (IP indemnity, Enterprise-grade security, safety, and privacy)
  + Copilot Enterprise - $39 per user/month (Chat personalized to your codebase, Documentation search and summaries, Code review skills, Fine-tuned model)

### Installing GitHub Copilot
  IDES such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Vim or Neovim

## A Beginner's Guide to Prompt Engineering with GitHub Copilot
### Introduction to Prompt Engineering 
`Prompt Engineering` - is the practice of giving an AI model specific instructions to produce the results you want
  + prompt
    + is a string of text or a code snippet designed to trigger a response from an AI model 
    + serve as a bridge between human intent and machine understanding, influencing the quality and precision of responses generated by LLMs

> The issue that leads to delivering expected outcomes, often lies in prompt contruction rather than the tools themselves.

### Best Practices For Prompt Crafting with GitHub Copilot
  + `Iterate and recraft your prompts`
    + set the stage with a high-level goal
      + providing a big-picture description within your prompt for a section of code or a new line that is completely blank
    + keep your prompts simple and specific
  + `Keep a couple of relevant tabs open in your editor`
  + `Give GitHub Copilot an example or two`
    + concepts like zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning

### LLMs and OpenAIs Codex That Powers GitHub Copilot
#### `LLMs`
  + generate humanlike language, whether presented as text completion or as chat
  + take a prompt and generate what a human would likely say next
  + training on massive amounts of text pretty much the entire internet

#### `Large-Language Model` vs `Large-Scale Model`: having a large number of parameters and being trained on a massive dataset
  + `Large-Language Model`: designed for natural language processing tasks, focusing on understanding and generating human language or code generation
  + `Large-Scale Model`: not necessarily focused on language but is characterized by their sheer size and complexity

####  GitHub Copilot uses `OpenAI's Codex` which is a descendant of `GPT-3`
  + training:
    + natural language
    + billions of lines of source code from publicly available sources including code in public GitHub repositories
  + decoder-only transformer model

> If using GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise, prompts are discarded after use, while individual users can choose whether to share prompts with GitHub Copilot. 

> Garbage collection (proxy server + openai model) removes suggestions from memory once they are transmitted to the code editor.
